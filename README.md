# ClauseSense 📝⚖️  
**AI-Powered Legal Document Analyzer**

**ClauseSense** is a machine learning project that classifies **legal contract clauses** into specific categories to assist with contract review and analysis.  
It explores both **traditional ML baselines** and **deep learning transformers (LegalBERT)**, providing a full pipeline from preprocessing to evaluation.

## 📂 Project Structure

### **Phase 2 – Baseline Models (Scikit-learn)**
- **Preprocessing with TF-IDF**  
- Trained **Logistic Regression, Linear SVM, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes**  
- Evaluated with **accuracy, macro-F1, and cross-validation**  

### **Phase 3 – Transformer Models (PyTorch/HuggingFace)**
- Fine-tuned **LegalBERT** for clause classification  
- Added **imbalance-aware training (class weights), scheduler, and early stopping**  
- Achieved **~73% accuracy** and **~0.55 macro-F1** on CUAD subset

## 📊 Results (Baseline vs Transformer)

| **Model**             | **Macro F1** | **Accuracy** | **Notes**              |
|------------------------|--------------|--------------|------------------------|
| Logistic Regression    | **0.61**     | ~0.62        | Best classical model   |
| Linear SVM             | 0.60         | ~0.61        | Competitive baseline   |
| Random Forest          | 0.51         | ~0.55        | Slower, less accurate  |
| Multinomial NB         | 0.40         | ~0.42        | Weak performance       |
| **LegalBERT (Phase 3)**| **0.55**     | **0.73**     | Strongest overall      |

## 📌 Example Usage
```python
demo_text = "This Agreement shall terminate upon thirty (30) days prior written notice."
pred, conf = predict_clause(demo_text)
print(f"Prediction: {pred} (confidence={conf:.2f})")

## Output:
Prediction: Termination For Convenience (confidence=0.78)
